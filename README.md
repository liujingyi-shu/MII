# MII
The MII dataset was recorded using a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with a length of 2.2m in the coastal waters of Qingdao, China (see Fig. ). The USV adopted a trimaran structure, consisting of a main hull and two side hulls. The main hull was designed to carry various onboard equipment, such as GPS, computing devices, and wireless APs, while the side hulls enhance its stability and load-carrying capacity. Three FLIR BFS-U3-120S4C-CS cameras were mounted on the vehicle at a height of 1.2m above the water surface. We only utilized cameras located on the left and right sides with a 0.3m baseline to capture marine scene data. The MII dataset contains 5000 pairs of time-synchronized marine images with a resolution of $512 \times 384$, covering diverse scenes under varying illumination conditions. The dataset can be used for training and testing reference-guided image inpainting models by leveraging random masks to generate damaged images.
